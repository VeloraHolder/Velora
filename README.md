**Velora-light** is an all-in-one PowerShell utility designed for power users, gamers, and privacy advocates. It unifies dozens of system tweaks into a clean, modular, interactive menu with built-in safety features like auto-restore points and detailed logging.

This is a complete, modernized rewrite of the original WinTweaks project.
